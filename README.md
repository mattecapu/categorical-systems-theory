# Notes on categorical systems theory

Categorical systems theory (CST) is a doubly-categorical framework for approaching and developing structural theories of systems and behaviour of any kind.
These notes are meant to be (1) a basic reference for CST and (2) a source of examples and working developments.
They're under active development, so quite far from camera-ready, and possibly never complete.
